# Higher-Lower Game
A simple Python game where you guess who has more Instagram followers: Account A or B.

## 🎯 Goal

You're shown two random celebrities or influencers. Your task is to guess which one has **more followers**. Get it right, your score goes up. Get it wrong, game over.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Each round, two accounts are picked randomly from a dataset.
- You guess which one has more followers.
- If you're correct, you move to the next round and your score increases.
- The game continues until you make a wrong guess.
